# Digital-Communication-System


Designed all the necessary blocks to build a virtual digital communication system using MATLAB

main.m is the master script which reads the Source Data text file and then calls the function representing the block of digital communication system one after another. At the end of the script, it checks whether both the transmitted and received message are similar or not.
